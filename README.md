# pybrarian
## IMPORTANT: This project was a project I worked on while still learning the fundamentals of Python, I had a ton of fun and learned a lot however this is not complete. If you would like and are someone similar to myself feel free to take the code and try to finish it and implement it as a bot! I wouldn't suggest using the current wikipedia api that is being used in this project as its rather inefficient and has search limitation! Good luck!

This is a librarian like API mean't to give the ability to webscrape important information regarding any book. Soon to be implemented as a Discord bot! (Written in Python!)
